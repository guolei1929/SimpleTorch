This is an app for Android phones.

What does this app?
===
It is a torch. It uses your camera's LED flashlight to let you see in the dark.

I created this app because I couldn't find a torch app that starts up fast and requires minimum permissions.

What permissions does this app need?

Only the camera permission. It is required to access the flashlight.
