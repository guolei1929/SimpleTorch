# Simple Torch ![icon](http://i.imgur.com/dBoSa.png)
A simple flashlight app for Android.<br/>
It uses your camera's LED flashlight to let you see in the dark.

#### What permissions does this app need?
* Camera

    > Required to access the flashlight.

#### Why? There are plenty of other flashlight apps.
I created this app because I couldn't find a torch app that starts up fast and requires minimum permissions.
> _most of the other apps want to know your location and other things for no reason..._
